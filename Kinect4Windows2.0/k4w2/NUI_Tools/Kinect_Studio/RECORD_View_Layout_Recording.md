RECORD View Layout - Recording Data  
===================================  

Kinect Studio supports the recording of data from the sensor array. Kinect Studio records the depth, IR, and body frame data streams from the sensor array. While recording, sensor data is displayed in the view window.  

You can select what streams to record. Some streams require other streams, to work. For example, depth requires IR. If you turn on one stream, the system will automatically select for recording (or playback) the other streams that are required for that stream to work.
