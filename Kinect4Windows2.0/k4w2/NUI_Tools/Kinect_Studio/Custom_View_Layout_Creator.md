Custom View Layout Creator  
==========================  

The Custom View Layout Creator and available views.  
You can create multiple windows and put them on separate monitors to maximize screen real estate usage. To create new top-level windows, and potentially move them to another monitor, use the **Create New Window** command in the **View** pane in the **File** tab. This command duplicates the current instance into an auxiliary window.  

You can choose an alternate tab within the auxiliary window, independent of the main window. You can select view layouts independently in each top-level window that you create.
