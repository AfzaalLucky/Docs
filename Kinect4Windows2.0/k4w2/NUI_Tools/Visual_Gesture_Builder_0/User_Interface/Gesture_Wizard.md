Gesture Wizard  
==============  

The Gesture Wizard is a step-by-step guide for creating and defining gestures for your collection. It will ask you several questions to help select the best training options for your gesture.  

To access the wizard, set focus to the solution node in the **Explorer** and then select **Help \> Gesture Wizard** or right-click on the solution, select **Create New Project** from the context menu, and then select the **Gesture Wizard** link at the top of the **Create Gesture Project** dialog.  

The majority of pages in the wizard will follow this simple format:
